			<p>I am interested in learning about different complaints in regards to the FCC regulations. I was able to find different complaints in regard to trying to get complaints from CNN, MSNBC, and FOX. I feel that this is very important to the research because it could give a history of what previous complaints looked like to these stations and how they are used to decipher what these stations could do better to avoid these complaints in the future. </p>
