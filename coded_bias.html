			<p>The scene that surprised me and stuck out to me the most would be the scene that describes how Tay thinks. I’ve seen chat gpt and AI in so many different places, but it was really frightening to me for people to train computers to learn the non-ethical standards of society. I also feel that it worries me a bit more for the future with technology and how AI is being used to complete tasks makes me question how knowledge is being learned in society today in schools and beyond.</p>
			<p>I’ve only really seen AI with ChatGPT and using it to help out with a problem in school, a task at work, etc. However, in this documentary it’s shown in ways that are a lot more about training people to act in a certain way. I remember Tay mentioning different slurs such as “I hate the Jews” and “Hitler did nothing wrong.” I haven’t really seen AI in that form before and it really surprised me when I got to hear how computers are trained from humans with very interesting thoughts to say the least.</p>
			<p>Two questions I would have would be what data is used for AI to come up with this story and how often does AI generate incidents like this from the given data that it finds, whether reliable or not? A hypothesis I have about this dataset is that a police report would be able to confirm or deny if an incident like a crash occurred because it would be able to say who was involved and the event that occurred, which AI is not on the scene for. </p>
