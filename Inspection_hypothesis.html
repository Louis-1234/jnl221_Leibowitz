			<p>I hypothesize that a majority of <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ocnWiCZm5avjK3Z3-jMV-OcTsdRFs8Wvkas_IzGH5_Y/edit?gid=1741339236#gid=1741339236" target="_blank">restraunts</a> will not correct their violations once inspected. I feel this is newswrothy because it will allow a lot of consumers of restraunt food an insight of how restraunts react to critique during inspections. I feel this is a good data hypothesis because it will affect what restraunts consumers go to more often than other ones. </p>
