			<h2> Academic Dishonesty is on the Rise</h2>

			<p>There is always a constant worry among any student in any level of institution; getting caught cheating. With a rise in technologies over the past few years, it has become much easier than ever to be able to manipulate assignments, exams, etc . That's made it harder to catch cheating. Dr. Ceceilia Parnther, an associate professor of executive leadership at Le Moyne, feels that the nature of the past decade has caused it to spike.</p>
			<p>“There was a huge spike post COVID,” said Parthner. “Because of the systems that were put in place with e- proctoring and things like that, you're going to see this huge increase.”</p>
			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic began in March of 2020. According to the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/annualreports/topical-studies/covid/" target="_blank">National Center for Education</a>, 77 percent of students in public schools went into distance learning and 84 percent of college students reported having online classes. One of those universities included Eastern Michigan University According to <a href="https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2025/07/31/Academic_Dishonesty_Report_Fall_21_-_Winter_25_-_Sheet1.pdf" target="_blank">data from the University</a>, 2022 saw the most amount of academic integrity violations between a four year span of 2021 to 2025. Parnther says that this is not a coincidence. “	Folks who choose to violate academic integrity policies I think now have it easier with the amount of resources that are available to them,” said Parnther.</p>
			<p>These resources that Parnther mentioned mostly focus around generative AI technologies. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/style/ai-chatgpt-turnitin-students-cheating.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, a Pew Research study indicated that in 2024, 26 percent of teenagers used ChatGPT to complete their schoolwork. This rate almost doubled the rate from 2023.</p>

			<h3>Uncertainty for Students of All Ages</h3>
			<p>However, for many students, a very big concern comes from stress that they could be accused of using AI when they did not use it on their assignments. This comes from the fact that many different AI generative software, such as TurnitIn, can be false at times. According to the New York Times,  a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15666" target="_blank">study</a> from the University of Maryland shows that human generated text was mistakenly identified as AI about 7% of the time. One of the authors of this study, Soheil Feizi, says that AI technology definitely does not come without its flaws. </p>
			<p>“Current detectors are not ready to be used in practice in schools to detect A.I. plagiarism,” said Feizi. 
			An example of a student that ends up going through the stress of this process is Leigh Burrell. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/style/ai-chatgpt-turnitin-students-cheating.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, Burrell, a computer-science major at the University of Houston, received a zero on an assignment that was worth a large chunk of her grade in a writing course. In a note to Burrell, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/17/style/ai-chatgpt-turnitin-students-cheating.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, her professor mentioned that he thought her paper was “outsourced by an AI chatbot.” </p>
			<p>Burrell ended up appealing the decision and her grade was eventually restored. However, this was a life-altering experience for Burrell. “My heart just freaking stops,” said Burrell.</p>

			<h3>What's Next for Higher Education?</h3>

			<iframe title="Plagiarism Occurred in 40% of Academic Dishonesty Violations" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-570jj" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/570jj/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="279" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
			<p>According to <a href="https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2025/07/31/Academic_Dishonesty_Report_Fall_21_-_Winter_25_-_Sheet1.pdf" target="_blank">Eastern Michigan University</a>, plagiarism resulted in 40% of academic violations over the course of this four year study. In addition, this study also showed that 33% of violations reported found the student not responsible or were informally resolved. Panther feels that cases like these vary because of how the judicial systems that universities go through are to hear these violations.</p>
			<p>“It's focusing on not only the elements of the appeal but also the elements of the misconduct with folks,” said Parnther. “Generally those have students on them as well.”</p>
			<p>As technologies continue to develop, no one really knows what is coming to higher education in terms of how academic dishonesty will grow. In many different ways, there is a continued debate of if generative AI is good or bad for students. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/08/learning/what-students-are-saying-about-using-ai-for-schoolwork.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, many students feel that it is beneficial to have AI accessible to them.</p>
			<p>“If you are doing a research project and you are researching a certain figure, you can use A.I. to pull up a doc all about them and their life,” said Christian, a student from Branford High School.</p>
			<p>But some seem to be wary of the benefits and harms of the technology. Teachers think that this technology can affect the way kids develop conceptual and critical thinking.</p>
			<p>“Someone needs to start talking about how adolescent brains work and what teens need to be doing in order to fully develop their prefrontal cortex,” said Nicole, a high school teacher. “Do we want to end up living in a society like in the movie Wall-E?” </p>
			<p>While there seems to be no clear direction, what many professionals feel is that this will only grow into things that we don’t know exist right now.</p>
			<p>“We need to understand what is commonly used by students,” said Parnther. “What is commonly used by faculty? There are plenty of opportunities and a lot of innovation with the use of these tools." </p>
			<p>However, Partner does feel there is a good way to solve cheating  problems related to AI going forward. “Understanding what is appropriate and then acknowledging violations is the more appropriate thing rather than a formal accusation,” said Parnther. </p>
