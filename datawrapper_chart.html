		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>This dataset shows the year that had the most amount of academic dishonesty violations from fall of 2021 to the spring of 2025 at Eastern Michgian University. It will be a part of story that details how common academic integrity has been lost due to violations.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="Year Violation Chart.png" alt="a chart of each violations" height="300px" width="400px">
		

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<p>I did not have this because the original datawrapper chart did not save to my desktop after I took the screenshot.</p>

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>I nedded to add in an annotation, footnote, and new visual hierarchy because he wanted  meto fix what was missing and add a bit more creativity to the chart as well.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="2022 had the Most Academic Dishonesty Violations" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-uWG1E" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uWG1E/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="511" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>


		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>I added in an annotation and changed the visual hierarchy of the chart. In addition, I added a footnote and focused on the trend of this dataset more clear. I did this because I think it makes the chart look cleaner and more presentable.</p>
