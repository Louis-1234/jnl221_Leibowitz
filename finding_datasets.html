			<p> This is my dataset about Columbia Policing and Michigan State University. </p>
			<ol>
				<strong><li>How is the data organized and collected?</strong> </li> This <a href="https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2021/05/18/Total_Number.pdf" target="_blank">data</a> is organized into a chart that is generally seen in a google sheet or excel organized into four charts of the incident number, type of incident, date of the incident, and the results that the police department of Columbia, Missouri posted. 
				<strong><li>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this? </strong> </li> I think that this is newsworthy because this data brings to light what the results of complaints of normal day citizens find in law enforcement of potential excessive force being used against them and it showcases how many incidents follow one or two different patterns. I think a good audience for this story would be any local reader in Columbia, Missouri. 
				<strong><li>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong></li> I hypothezize that in Columbia, Missouri, a majority of citizen complaints of excessive force of law enforcement will end in no result (no misconduct alleged, unfounded, not sustained, etc.) in 2020.</p>

		<p>This <a href="https://cdn.muckrock.com/foia_files/2025/07/31/Academic_Dishonesty_Report_Fall_21_-_Winter_25_-_Sheet1.pdf" target="_blank">data</a> is organized into a chart that is generally seen in a google sheet or excel organized into data detailing who the students are, what they allegedly did, the result of the incident reported, if DOS got involved, and much more. This is newsworthy because it outlines what college students have tried to do to undermine the higher education system especially right after COVID started. The audience that is good for this would be college parents and university officials. I hypothesize that from late 2021 to early 2025, most Eastern University students caught with some form of plagiarism would not face DOS intervention</p>
